# Sudoku solver in Scala

This is a little project in Scala that solves a sudoku using backtracking.
It also pretty prints the sudoku if it's been solved.

## Installation

You will need Scala installed on your system:
- macOS: `brew install scala`
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install scala`
- Windows: look around [here](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html)

When you can access both `scalac` and `scala` from the command line, just do
```
scalac *.scala
scala Main
```
And it will compile and execute.
